  A Fusion Reactor, abundant fuel supply, comparison of fission and fusion: efficiently
  converts mass to energy, fusion reactors, contibution to air pollution or global
  warming, uncontrolled energy release, negligible quantities of high-level waste,
  why aren''t fusion reactors build, the fusion process, fusion power generation,
  fusion energy requirements, forces of fields on plasma, Tokamak coils, and the energy
  breakeven.'
