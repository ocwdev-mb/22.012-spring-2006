Course Description

Fusion Energy has the potential to provide almost unlimited amounts of electric power with minimal environmental impact. This seminar covers a range of plasma and fusion energy topics, including discussion of the Global Energy Picture, the Physics of Fusion, Fusion Reactors and Tokamaks. A Tour of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center including the Alcator C-MOD Tokamak is part of the seminar. In addition, other fusion related topics are discussed including Plasma Rockets for Manned Space Missions and Plasma Fuel Converters for Environmentally Improved Cars and Trucks.
